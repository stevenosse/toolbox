# Toolbox

I use a lot of tools on a daily basis, whether at work or for my personal needs, and this repo is intended to share those tools with people who might be passing by.
I hope you'll discover some cool tools!

## General purpose
- [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai): My alternative to Google. I use it daily for advices, DIY or repair work ><
- [Lluminous](https://lluminous.chat/): I use it as an alternative to Groq on the web as it offers a convenient UI + has persistant storage (unlike Groq!)
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com): To generate content or to shape my ideas. I'll give him my raw thoughts and give it a lot of context and directions so it returns the most qualitative answer

## Design
- [Recraft](https://recraft.ai): I use this mainly to generate logos and illustrations. It includes some tools for basic image edition
- [SVGL](https://svgl.app/): To find SVG logos (for companies, frameworks and tools)
- [Blobmaker](https://www.blobmaker.app/): Generate blob shapes
- [Lottiefiles](https://lottiefiles.com/): For animations. I don't have any talent when it comes to motion design or creating animations so i rely heavily on other people's work ><

## Programming
### Web
#### UI Component library
